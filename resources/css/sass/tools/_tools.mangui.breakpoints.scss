 *
 * 		[a]	Reset a variable required for our conditional statement to work.
 *      [b]	Loop through each breakpoint in $mangui-breakpoints
 *      [c]	Get the 'name' and 'declaration' from each breakpoint
 *      [d]	If the name of the breakpoint matches our mixin variable
 *      [e]	Tell the variable we've found it, so it doesn't continue through the if()
 *      [f]	Output our media query, using the breakpoint declaration and the content provided
 * 		    within the @include
 *   	[g]	If $point did not match any of the breakpoints within $mangui-breakpoints
 *    	[h]	Create a media query using the value of $point
