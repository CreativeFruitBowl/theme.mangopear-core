## About MangUI

Tired of working with opinionated frameworks that you need to unpick before you can begin development?

**Well, struggle no more.**

With MangUI, you can get designing and developing straight away. MangUI is built on principles and frameworks that you're already familiar with - BEMIT, ITCSS, Normalize.css and more.

## Installation

* In your WordPress build, create a new folder in the themes directory `/wp-content/themes/`
* Give the new folder a useful name
* Fork this repository into the new folder
* **or** download the latest version of the framework and copy the files across to your new theme

It's that simple. You can now start designing and developing your next WordPress theme.

## Next steps

There are a few things that we'd recommend you do first:

* Open the style.css document in the root of the framework and give it a meaningful name. This is the name that will appear in the WordPress dashboard
* You'll also want to install the node modules that are needed for the Gulp processing. *Instructions coming soon for this*
